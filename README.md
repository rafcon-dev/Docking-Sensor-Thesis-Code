# Docking Sensor Thesis Code
The code for the Arduino based docking sensor from my master thesis.
Its purpose was to do what a roomba does when docking in its docking station for example, using a camera from a Wiimote (Pixart), and three infrared LEDs on the docking station to infer the robots position.

The folder ROBOT contains a Processing program to communicate with the Arduino, so we can see what the camera is seeing, to help debugging.
